# Vignettes

Several vignettes that cover the general use of this package are available, and can
be viewed either by exploring the committed html files 
[here](https://gitlab.com/data-analysis5/phenotypes/process.phenotypes/doc/),
or via listing the available vignettes by running 
`vignette(package = "process.phenotypes")` in an R interpreter.  Note that if you
installed the package via `devtools`, you will only be able to see the vignettes in
this way if you set `build_vignettes=TRUE`, as shown in the [installation](installation.md)
section.

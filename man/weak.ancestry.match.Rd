\title{Attempt to use string similarity to guess what people
meant by their self-reported ancestry.}
\usage{
weak.ancestry.match(
  phenotype,
  ancestry.data,
  best.match.threshold = 0.9,
  best.match.discernment = 0.75
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype}{character vector, input free-text
self-reported ancestry; only for subjects with no
perfect match to ancestry dictionary!!}

\item{ancestry.data}{named character vector, linking from unique
possible input ancestries to harmonized ancestry label. note that
both entries and names in this vector are assumed to have gone
through approximately analogous processing as the input free-text
ancestry group labels, e.g. made lowercase and had whitespace removed.}

\item{best.match.threshold}{numeric, on \link{0,1}, denoting how high
the best match similarity must be to permit a call}

\item{best.match.discernment}{numeric, on \link{0,1} denoting the proportion
of the top match the next best match must be less than (assuming the
next best match does not map to the same harmonized label) in order
to accept the top match}
}
\value{
list; first entry is character vector, modified version of
the input ancestry reports, modified to best guess ancestry, or
NA if the best match is poor; second entry is character vector
describing the reasoning for accepting or rejecting partial matches;
third is best ancestry match regardless of acceptance; fourth is
quality of best match; fifth is second best ancestry match;
sixth is quality of second best match
}
\description{
Self-reported free-text ancestry is messy. If it perfectly
matches the ancestry dictionary, that's great; but if it
doesn't, and plenty of them don't, we have to try to guess.
But guessing is hard, so deliberately fail a lot.

Will report them when I have them.
